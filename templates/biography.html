        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jivan Adhikari, and I am a dedicated medical lab scientist based in New Hampshire. With years of experience in clinical lab work, I have developed a deep understanding of diagnostic procedures and healthcare, playing an essential role in ensuring the well-being of patients. Outside of the lab, I have a profound connection to nature, where I find peace and creativity. Whether it's hiking through the rugged terrains of New Hampshire or capturing moments through writing and sketching, I embrace the outdoors and art as a way to balance the technical with the creative.</p>
        <p>Driven by an insatiable curiosity, I have embarked on an exciting new chapter in my professional journey: transitioning into the world of machine learning. Inspired by its potential to revolutionize healthcare and many other industries, I am currently pursuing a master’s program that has sparked my passion for data science and artificial intelligence. As I delve deeper into this field, I am eager to merge my healthcare background with the power of data to explore innovative solutions that can make a tangible impact on people’s lives.</p>
